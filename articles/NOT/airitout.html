        <h2>A Letter From The Author</h2>
        <p>We are often told not to air out our dirty laundry and
            to preserve a certain image of ourselves. Controversial subjects are often deemed as
            unworthy of discussion, leading to a habit of silencing those who have something to
            say. I, for one, don’t think anyone should be shamed into silence, and believe it’s time to
            air out all the dirty laundry our society tries so desperately to conceal. What you’re
            about to embark on is a journey into the minds of your fellow UTD classmates as they
            air out their personal experiences and “hot takes” on our society today. These articles
            will highlight personal stories built on courage, an in-depth analysis of the path this
            country is taking, and the fight against stereotypes.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Well, what are you waiting for?</em></strong></em></p>

        </div>
        <p>Is the price of being yourself one you’re willing to pay? We often believe it is, holding
            steadfast in our conviction to transform into the best, most authentic versions of
            ourselves while simultaneously saying “screw them, this is my life” to those who would
            oppose. In a perfect world, we would all have the freedom to ignore the outside noise,
            but this isn’t a perfect world. It’s human nature to absorb the opinions of others when
            going through life, often using them as guideposts that alert us if we’re about to fall off a
            cliff. But maybe some of us intended to take a leap, and these opinions actually serve as
            barbed wire, fencing us in and limiting growth.</p>
        <p>Julia understands this feeling all too well, having grown up Catholic and born into a
            multicultural household; her mother is Mexican and her father is a white American from
            Texas. Julia often found it difficult to adhere to the strict teachings of the catholic
            church while also living up to the expectations that were placed on her.</p>

            <h2>Interview #2: Manjiri</h2>
        </div>

        <p>When did individualism become isolation? Success become seclusion? Has our society
            become so focused on individual achievements that we’ve lost touch with our sense of
            community? These questions are heavy, and the answers may never be found. It’s the
            natural law for societies to morph as they go through their cycles, locked in an infinite
            spiral and leaving all of us desperately grasping to the debris to keep upright. However,
            recently, we’ve found ourselves void of any ground to stand on while our society spirals
            into a deep-seated era of hyper-individualism, and I’m not the only one who thinks so.
            Manjiri has noticed the hard shift to hyper-individualism that has taken over our
            society, leaving lasting routines that threaten to define the 21st century.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The fate of our society should be determined by the quality of the way we treat each
            other in the smallest acts of daily life, but has the avalanche of daily media cycles made
            us too apathetic towards serious societal issues and events? As a Palestinian American,
            this issue has certainly come to life for Noor, and this interview will include an open
            conversation about this topic in more detail from her perspective.</p>

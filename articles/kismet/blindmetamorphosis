            When the acorns start to flood the sidewalk, I like to scoop up the very best and
            collect them for fairy gardens.
            <br><br>
            I rub them against the pavement until it stains yellow, letting me know I 
            begin to scrape out the paste-like pollen.
            <br><br>
            The hollowed-out shells represent anything my young mind sees; I create dining
            room scenes, platonic picnic dates, and bunkbed sleepovers.
            <br><br>
            Wings sprouting from my cocoon. Picturing myself better. A life directed only
            by the changing winds.
            <br><br>
            Will my childhood dreams play out like the movies?
            Do I really end up by the sea? Will I learn to love how I live?
            Esther Greenwood's fig tree has nothing on the acorn trees of my youth. </p>

    <section class="full-para">
        <p style="text-align: left;"> "Let God into your hearts," preached in unison to the strangers
            we spend each day soliciting. I'm giving back to my community in the name of
            Christ, but nothing in me believes in some higher power. I search their faces for a
            hint of true faith; they must hold the same longing to confirm their deepest desire
            - is any of it real? The pull-out couch in our too-full hotel room becomes my
            haven. I plead at the water-stained ceiling to give me any sort of sign. The
            incessant questioning with no real response forces my brain to sludge; a
            caterpillar melting in its chrysalis. Wasps swarm my growing cocoon before I get
            the chance to end the cycle. </p>

            It’s senior year of college, and rather than looking to the future,
            <br><br>
            I can only manage to pick apart a past that doesn’t lead to my dreams.
            <br><br>
            Instead of new possibilities, I’m weighted by all those I have missed.
            <br><br>
            There is no rubric. No underlined rights and wrongs anymore.
            <br><br>
            God, it’s Me again. Is there a way to know it all works out in the end?
            <br><br>
            It is written, yes I know, but where, when is it written?
            <br><br>
            I’m scared, God, it’s Me again. </p>

            was so preoccupied with my future, so blind, that I missed my own molting. The
